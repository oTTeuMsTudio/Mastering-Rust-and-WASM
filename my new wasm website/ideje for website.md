You can now expand on this project by adding more features, you can add a scoring system or give the user the ability to restart the game.


**Adding a Scoring System and Restart Functionality in Rust**

### Understanding the Game
To implement a scoring system and a restart option, we'll need to have a basic understanding of your game's structure. Let's assume a simple text-based game where the player makes choices that affect a score.

### Implementing a Scoring System

1. **Define a Score Variable:**
   * Create a variable to store the current score.
   * Initialize it to 0 at the start of the game.

2. **Update the Score Based on Choices:**
   * Within your game logic, when the player makes a choice, increment or decrement the score accordingly.
   * For example, if a correct choice adds 10 points:
     ```rust
     score += 10;
     ```

3. **Display the Score:**
   * Periodically, print the current score to the console.
   * You can do this after each choice or at the end of a level or game.

### Implementing a Restart Function

1. **Use a Loop:**
   * Enclose your game logic within a loop.
   * This loop will continue until the player decides to quit or the game ends naturally.

2. **Check for Restart Input:**
   * After each game cycle, ask the player if they want to restart.
   * You can use a simple input mechanism like `std::io::stdin().read_line()` to get user input.
   * If the input indicates a restart, break the loop and start a new game cycle.

### Code Example

```rust
use std::io::{stdin, stdout, Write};

fn main() {
    let mut score = 0;

    loop {
        // Game logic here...
        // ...

        // Update score based on choices
        if player_made_correct_choice {
            score += 10;
        } else {
            score -= 5;
        }

        println!("Your current score: {}", score);

        // Ask if the player wants to restart
        println!("Do you want to play again? (y/n)");
        stdout().flush().unwrap();

        let mut input = String::new();
        stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();

        if input.trim().to_lowercase() == "n" {
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

### Additional Considerations

* **Complex Scoring Systems:** For more complex scoring systems, consider using a struct to store multiple score components.
* **Game Over Conditions:** Implement conditions to end the game, such as reaching a certain score or failing a specific task.
* **User Interface:** For a more user-friendly experience, consider using a library like `raylib` to create a graphical user interface.
* **Error Handling:** Handle potential errors, such as invalid user input, gracefully.

By following these steps and considering the additional points, you can effectively implement a scoring system and a restart function in your Rust game.
